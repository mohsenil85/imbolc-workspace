# Drums

Synthesized drum sounds.

## Kick

Bass drum / kick drum synthesis.

**Parameters:**
- Pitch: Fundamental frequency
- Decay: How long the sound rings
- Click: Initial transient intensity
- Drive: Distortion/saturation

**Tips:**
- Lower pitch for sub-bass heavy kicks
- Add click for punch that cuts through mix
- Drive adds harmonics for presence on small speakers

## Snare

Snare drum synthesis with noise burst and body.

**Parameters:**
- Pitch: Body tuning
- Snare: Wire snare intensity
- Decay: Ring time
- Tone: Body brightness

**Tips:**
- More snare = tighter, less = looser/fatter
- Short decay = tight, long = open/roomy

## HiHat

Hi-hat cymbal synthesis (closed and open variants).

**Parameters:**
- Decay: Ring time (short=closed, long=open)
- Tone: Brightness / metallic character
- Ring: Resonant frequencies

**Tips:**
- Very short decay for tight closed hats
- Longer decay with resonance for open hats

## Clap

Hand clap synthesis with layered transients.

**Parameters:**
- Spread: Timing variation between hits
- Tone: Frequency content
- Room: Reverberant tail

## Cowbell

Classic cowbell synthesis.

**Parameters:**
- Pitch: Fundamental tuning
- Decay: Ring time
- Tone: Brightness

## Rim

Rim shot / cross-stick synthesis.

**Parameters:**
- Pitch: Tuning
- Crack: Transient sharpness
- Body: Wooden body resonance

## Tom

Tom-tom drum synthesis.

**Parameters:**
- Pitch: Drum tuning
- Decay: Ring time
- Attack: Stick impact character

## Clave

Wooden clave stick synthesis.

**Parameters:**
- Pitch: Wood resonance
- Decay: Ring time

## Conga

Conga drum synthesis.

**Parameters:**
- Pitch: Head tuning
- Slap: Palm slap character
- Tone: Open tone character
